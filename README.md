# QuotaOverhaul

The goal of Quota Overhaul is to make the quota system as fun, rewarding, and configurable as possible.  I've taken inspiration from several existing mods, added some stuff of my own, and I'm always taking input from the community.

### THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA
Here be bugs!  Probably.  I'm actively fixing issues as they arise.  If you encounter a bug, check the github issues to see if it has been reported.  If not, please create an issue to let me know.

# Features

### Starting Credits
You can configure the starting credits.  Yay!

### Quota Variables
You can configure the starting quota, change other settings for how fast it increases, and modify the impact of RNG.

### Quota Deadline
You can configure the number of days you have to complete the quota.  You can also configure the soonest day that the quota is allowed to end.

### Player Count Scaling
The quota increases the more players you have.  This should make high player counts more balanced.  The scaling is always based on the highest number of concurrent players during the current quota, to avoid exploits.  Very configurable.

### Configurable Credit Fines
You can toggle fines on and off, change the percent fine per dead player, or use the new Dynamic Mode, which is more configurable and scales based on the number of players online (specifically, the highest player count on a given moon run).

### Quota Death Penalties
You get penalties to the quota for dying!  This is intended to replace losing all your scrap when all players die, and maybe the credit fines if you want.  Configurable with the same options as credit fines.

### Loot Saving
You can configure exactly what happens to your loot when all players die.  You can keep it all, lose it all like vanilla, set a chance for each item to be saved, or a collective chance for your whole hoard.

### Equipment Loss
Configurable equipment loss!  This has similar settings to loot saving.

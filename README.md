# QuotaOverhaul

The purpose of this mod is to make the quota system as fun, rewarding, and configurable as possible.
Quota Overhaul combines ideas from several existing mods, and makes them fully functional and compatible.

# Features

Quota Variables:  You can configure the starting quota, minimum increase, increase steepness and randomness multiplier (these are internal variables in vanilla).  Inspiration:  Quota Tweaks by mrov.

**Player Count Scaling:**
The quota increases the more players you have.  This should make high player counts more balanced.  The scaling is always based on the highes number of concurrent players seen during that quota, to avoid exploits.  Very configurable.

**Configurable Credit Fines:**
You can toggle fines on and off, change the percent fine per dead player, or use the new Dynamic Mode, which is more configurable and scales based on the number of players online (specifically, the record player count on a given moon run).

**Increase Quota on Death:**
You get penalties to the quota for dying!  This is intended to replace losing all your scrap when all players die, and maybe the credit fines if you want.  Configurable with the same options as credit fines.  Inspiration:  Custom Death Penalty by ImpulsiveLass.

**Loot Saving:**
You can keep all your hard earned scrap, set a 50/50 chance for each precious piece loot, lose it all, or anything in between.  Inspiration:  Save Our Loot by MrHydralisk.

**Equipment Loss:**
You could also risk your handy equipment for an extra punishing experience.  Inspiration:  Save Our Loot by MrHydralisk.

# Roadmap

**Make an Icon:**  Yeah gonna need to do that.

**Dynamic Difficulty:**  Increase enemy power level and dungeon size based on the quota.  Inspired by Custom Death Penalty.

**Dynamic Loot:**  Increase the scrap value and scrap spawns.  Also inspired by Custom Death Penalty.

**Dynamic Dungeon Size:**  Increase the dungeon size based on the quota.

**Your Ideas:**  I'm definitely open to adding other configurable, quota-related features!

## Features

You start with 300 credits instead of 60  
The quota starts at 250  
The second quota is 400  
The quota will rack up slightly faster  
There is no randomness applied to the quota  
The quota scales sensibly for larger crews  

You don't lose any credits for dead players  
You don't lose any scrap on a team wipe  
Instead the quota increases for each player that dies  
Collecting bodies decreases the quota penalty

**Everything in Quota Overhaul is configurable**  
Install Lethal Config or use your mod manager and look through the configuration options  
Each option has a description, so hopefully you can figure it out from that.  If not, feel free to DM me @LuciusofLegend on discord.

## Roadmap

- Dynamic Scrap loss, similar to Credit and Quota Penalties

## Licensing:

Quota Overhaul is released under the GPLv3 license.
This means you are free to distribute your own version, provided you release it under the same license.
For the moment, if you encounter issues with the mod I encourage you to open an issue on github so I can fix it,
but if I stop maintaining the mod and it starts breaking on new game versions, feel free to make a fork.

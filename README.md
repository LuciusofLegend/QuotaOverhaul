## QuotaTweaks by mrov

Quota Tweaks is a very simple mod that exposes the internal vanilla variable QuotaSettings to the user and makes it configurable. Since it's released under the permissive MIT License, I basically stole the whole thing. Thank you mrov!

## SaveOurLoot by MrHydralisk

Save Our Loot adds various options around saving your loot when all players die. It's very flexible but straightforward. Save Our Loot is released under the GPL v3 License, which allows modification and distribution. Thanks to MrHydralisk for the solid mod!

## CustomDeathPenalty by ImpulsiveLass

Custom Death Penalty adds extensive configuration of fines, and also a new quota penalty system. This was probably the main inspiration for Quota Overhaul. Unfortunately, I could not steal any code from this mod because for some reason the github repository was deleted. But thank you to ImpulsiveLass anyway for the great ideas!

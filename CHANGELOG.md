# QuotaOverhaul Changelog

## 1.4.0

- Fixed a bunch of issues with belt bags
- Changed the "Loot Saving" configs to "Loot Loss". I did this because it makes the code and option names more consistent. You should delete your config and relaunch before making edits. Read the config descriptions so you know what has changed. Sorry for the inconvenience.
